## The Naive Bayes classifier works on the principle of conditional probability, as given by the Bayes theorem.

* `Face Recognition`
As a classifier, it is used to identify the faces or its other features, like nose, mouth, eyes, etc.

* `Weather Prediction` 
It can be used to predict if the weather will be good or bad.

* `Medical Diagnosis` 
Doctors can diagnose patients by using the information that the classifier provides. Healthcare professionals can use Naive Bayes to indicate if a patient is at high risk for certain diseases and conditions, such as heart disease, cancer, and other ailments. 

* `News Classification `
With the help of a Naive Bayes classifier, Google News recognizes whether the news is political, world news, and so on. 

As the Naive Bayes Classifier has so many applications, it’s worth learning more about how it works.




### Advantages of Naive Bayes Classifier 
The following are some of the benefits of the Naive Bayes classifier: 

* It is simple and easy to implement
* It doesn’t require as much training data
* It handles both continuous and discrete data
* It is highly scalable with the number of predictors and data points
* It is fast and can be used to make real-time predictions
* It is not sensitive to irrelevant features
